# COVID-19-in-India
Personal project that includes my python code, which was used to web-scrape a table of information from wikipedia,
and a link to the Tableau dashboard that was used to visualize the acquired data.  

I have added the screenshots of the Wikipedia page from which the data was extracted.
The contents of the URL might change in the future, as of now, the code seems to work just fine for the given URL. 

Click on the Tableau Public link below to view the visualizations created with the extracted data. 

The dashboard includes two visualizations
1. A map of India with both States and Union Territories highlighted with a red dot. Hover your mouse over it and it will show you the sum of overall cases, active cases, total deaths, and total recoveries from the inception of COVID-19 in India.

2. A horizontal bar chart of each of the aforementioned categories
to get an accurate visual representation of the data. 

In order to view the map or the bar chart individually click on the links at the bottom of the page under the heading "metadata".

The data source refreshes daily, making the dashboard reliable with accurate data. 

Let me know what you think.
